- **Fairness**: Equal treatment regardless of protected characteristics

## Compliance Requirements Implementation

### 1. Risk Management System (Article 9)

All high-risk AI systems implement comprehensive risk management:

```python
# Example from healthcare eligibility
ai_act_compliance = {
    "risk_level": "high_risk",
    "classification": "medical_device_ai_system",
    "requires_human_review": requires_human_review,
    "human_oversight_reasons": human_oversight_reasons,
    "risk_management": {
        "risk_assessment_completed": True,
        "mitigation_measures_applied": len(warnings) > 0,
        "monitoring_plan_active": True
    }
}
```

### 2. Data Governance (Article 10)

All systems implement data quality and governance measures:

```python
"data_governance": {
    "data_quality_assessed": True,
    "bias_monitoring_enabled": True,
    "accuracy_metrics_tracked": True
}
```

### 3. Technical Documentation (Article 11)

Comprehensive technical documentation maintained for all systems:
- System architecture and design
- Training data and methodologies
- Performance metrics and limitations
- Risk assessment and mitigation measures

### 4. Record Keeping (Article 12)

Immutable trace ledger maintains comprehensive records:
- Decision execution logs
- Input/output data
- Human oversight actions
- Audit trails and compliance documentation

### 5. Transparency and Information (Article 13)

All systems provide clear information to users:
- System capabilities and limitations
- Decision reasoning and methodology
- Human oversight requirements
- Appeal and redress mechanisms

### 6. Human Oversight (Article 14)

Critical decisions require human oversight:
- Medical procedure denials
- Visa application denials
- High-value benefit decisions
- Complex cases with multiple factors

### 7. Accuracy, Robustness, and Cybersecurity (Article 15)

Systems implement comprehensive accuracy and security measures:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output verification and testing
- Cybersecurity protections
- Robustness testing and monitoring

## Bias Detection and Mitigation

### Protected Characteristics Monitoring

All systems monitor for bias based on protected characteristics:

```python
bias_assessment = {
    "nationality_bias_detected": False,  # Removed nationality-based decisions
    "gender_bias_detected": False,
    "age_bias_detected": False,
    "religion_bias_detected": False,
    "disability_bias_detected": False,
    "bias_mitigation_applied": True,
    "fairness_metrics_tracked": True
}
```

### Individual Assessment Approach

Systems use individual assessment rather than group-based decisions:

```python
# Immigration system example - individual risk assessment
individual_risk_factors = []
if criminal_record:
    individual_risk_factors.append("criminal_history")
if security_concerns:
    individual_risk_factors.append("security_concerns")
# No nationality-based risk assessment
```

## Transparency Measures

### Decision Explainability

All systems provide comprehensive decision explanations:

```python
"transparency_measures": [
    "Decision reasoning provided",
    "Eligibility criteria clearly stated",
    "Appeal process available",
    "Data sources disclosed"
]
```

### Methodology Disclosure

Clear disclosure of decision-making methodology:
- Calculation formulas and algorithms
- Risk assessment criteria
- Eligibility requirements
- Appeal and redress procedures

## Human Oversight Implementation

### Critical Decision Triggers

Human oversight required for:
- All denied applications (immigration, benefits)
- Critical medical procedure decisions
- High-value benefit allocations
- Complex cases with multiple factors
- Security watchlist cases

### Oversight Process

```python
# Example oversight implementation
if application_status == ApplicationStatus.DENIED:
    requires_human_review = True
    human_oversight_reasons.append("All visa denials require human review per EU AI Act")
```

## Legal References

All systems include comprehensive legal references:

```python
"legal_references": [
    "https://finlex.fi/fi/laki/alkup/2010/20100580#L1",  # Patient Safety Act
    "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679",  # GDPR
    "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32021L0426",  # EU AI Act
]
```

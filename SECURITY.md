# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities in the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@policy-as-code.org**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, we will:

1. Confirm receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
2. Provide regular updates about our progress
3. Credit you in our security advisories (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive mypy type checking (66% error reduction achieved)
- **Static Analysis**: Pre-commit hooks with security-focused linting
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks integration to prevent credential exposure

### Runtime Security

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with mTLS support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable cryptographic audit trails
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

### Infrastructure Security

- **Container Security**: Trivy scanning for container vulnerabilities
- **Infrastructure Scanning**: TFSec for Terraform security analysis
- **Supply Chain Security**: SLSA provenance and SBOM generation
- **Signed Artifacts**: Cryptographic signing of all releases

### Policy Security

- **Default Deny**: All policies enforce default-deny principles
- **Policy Validation**: Schema validation for all policy definitions
- **Replay Protection**: Nonce and TTL-based replay attack prevention
- **Drift Detection**: Automated detection of policy inconsistencies

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
2. **Validate all inputs**: Sanitize and validate user inputs
3. **Use type hints**: Leverage Python's type system for safety
4. **Follow secure coding practices**: Use established security patterns
5. **Test security scenarios**: Include security-focused test cases

### For Users

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update to latest versions
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use encrypted connections
3. **Implement proper authentication**: Use strong authentication mechanisms
4. **Monitor audit logs**: Regularly review audit trail entries
5. **Follow principle of least privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
